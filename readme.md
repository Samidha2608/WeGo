## ðŸ§  Project Overview

WeGo Portal is a Django-based web application designed to help students reinforce their learning through interactive tools like flashcards, quizzes, and interview questions. The platform is organized around **Batches**, which contain multiple **Lectures**. Each lecture can have associated **Flashcards** for revision, **Quiz Questions** for self-assessment, and **Interview Questions** to help users prepare for real-world scenarios. Users can log in to view topic-specific content, test their knowledge, and track their understanding. The admin dashboard allows staff to easily manage batches, lectures, and questions. Students can explore content for each lecture, answer questions in quiz format, revise key points using flashcards, and practice important questions for interviews. The platform emphasizes a smooth user experience, modular content management, and a structured learning path â€” making it ideal for academic reinforcement and placement preparation.
